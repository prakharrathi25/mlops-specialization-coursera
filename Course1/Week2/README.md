# Week 2: Select and Train a Model

Identify the key challenges in model development and understand how performance on a small set of disproportionately important examples may be more crucial than performance on the majority of examples. 

### Learning Objectives
- Identify the key components of the ML Lifecycle.
- Define “concept drift” as it relates to ML projects.
- Differentiate between shadow, canary, and blue-green deployment scenarios in the context of varying degrees of automation.
- Compare and contrast the ML modeling iterative cycle with the cycle for deployment of ML products.
- List the typical metrics you might track to monitor concept drift.
