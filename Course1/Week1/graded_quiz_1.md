# Graded Quiz 1 - The Machine Learning Project Lifecycle 

> **Q1. Which of these are stages of the machine learning project lifecycle? Check all that apply.**

- [x] Data
- [x] Modelling 
- [x] Scoping
- [ ] Configuration
- [x] Deployment

> **Q2. Which of these is not an advantage of a typical edge deployment compared to a typical cloud deployment?**

- [ ] Less network bandwidth needed
- [ ] Can function even if network connection is down
- [ ] Lower latency
- [x] More computational power available
  
> **Q3. In the speech recognition example, what is the problem with some labelers transcribing audio as “Um, today’s weather” and others transcribing “Umm..., today’s weather”?**

- [ ] The first is grammatically incorrect and we should use the second transcription.
- [x] Either transcription is okay, but the inconsistency is problematic.
- [ ] The second is grammatically incorrect and we should use the first transcription. 
- [ ] We should not be transcribing “Umm.” The correct transcription, which serves the user's needs better, is just “Today’s weather.

> **Q4. After a system is deployed, monitoring and maintaining the system will help us handle cases of concept drift or data drift.**

- [x] True
- [ ] False 

> **Q5. Which statement is a more accurate description of the full cycle of a machine learning project?**

- [ ] It is a linear process, in which we move step-by-step from scoping to deployment. (That’s why we call it a cycle. Bicycles are only good at going forward, not backward.)
- [x] It is an iterative process, where during a later stage we might go back to an earlier stage. (That’s why we call it a cycle--it’s a circular process.)
